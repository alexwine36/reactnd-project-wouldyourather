# Would You Rather Project

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and with the `--scripts-version=react-scripts-ts` flag.

The application pulls users in from the \_DATA.js file which imitates a promise based API. Questions and users are pulled in and the authenticated user can then vote on the option that they agree with. The results are recorded using redux and leaders are tabulated based on the results.

### About

The application uses typescript for type safety and in an attempt to ease the use of redux.
